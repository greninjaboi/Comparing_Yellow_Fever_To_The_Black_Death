    <h2>About Yellow Fever:</h2>

    <p><em>What is yellow fever?</em><br>
        The article <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/yellow-fever">"Yellow
            Fever"</a> states, "Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease trasmitted by infected mosquitos.
        The 'yellow' in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients."</p>
    <p><em>How is yellow fever transmitted?</em><br>
        The article <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/yellow-fever">"Yellow
            Fever"</a> states, "The yellow fever virus is an arbovirus of the flavivirus genus and is transmitted by
        mosquitoes, belonging to the <em>Aedes</em> and <em>Haemogogus</em> species. The different mosquito species live
        in different
        habitats - some breed around houses (domestic), others in the jungle (wild), and some in both habitats
        (semi-domestic)." </p>
    <p><span class=list_starter>There are 3 different types of transmission cycles for yellow fever:</span></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sylvatic (also known as jungle) yellow fever:</strong><br>
            In tropical rainforests, monkeys get bit by mosquitos from the <em>Aedes</em> or <em>Haemogogus</em> species
            and contract yellow fever. These monkeys then spread yellow fever to other monkeys. Sometimes, people
            travelling or doing work in the rainforset get bitten by mosquitos with the infection and contract yellow
            fever</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate yellow fever:</strong><br>
            Partially doemstic mosquitos (mosquitos that breed both around homes and in the wild) spread the virus to
            both humans and monkeys. Increased contact between infected mosquios and people leads to increased
            transmission and villages in a similar area can develop outbreaks at the same time. This is the most common
            outbreak type in Africa.</li>
        <li><strong>Urban yellow fever:</strong><br>
            Extensive epidemics happen when people with the virus spread it into highly populated areas that have a
            thick density of <em>Aedes aegypti</em> and people that have little to no immunity. A low immunity could be
            caused due to not being vaccinated or from prior exposure to the virus. In these conditions, mosquitos with
            yellow fever transmit it from person to person.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>What are the symptoms of yellow fever?</em><br>
        The symptoms of yellow fever include, but are not limited to, headaches, fevers, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea,
        vomiting, and fatigue.</p>
    <p><em>How deadly is yellow fever?</em><br>
        A small amount of patients who get the yellow fever end up developing severe symptoms and roughly half of those
        patients die within 7 to 10 days.</p>
    <p><em>How is yellow fever diagnosed?</em><br>
        It is difficult to diagnose yellow fever, especially in its early stages. A severe case can be confused with
        leptospirosis, sever malaria, viral hepatitis (especially fulminant forms), poisoning, other haemorrhagic
        fevers, and infection with other flaviviruses (such as dengue haemorrhagic fever.)<br>
        Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in urine and blood sometimes can detect yellow fever in the early stages
        of the disease. In later stages, testing to identify antibodies is required (PRNT and ELISA).</p>
    <p><em>Where is the yellow fever most common?</em><br>
        In modern times, yellow fever is endemic in the tropical areas of Africa and Central/South America. However, the
        virus was much more widespread in other areas before the creation of the yellow fever vaccine.<br>
        The article <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/yellow-fever">"Yellow
            Fever"</a> states, "Large epidemics of yellow fever occur when infected people introduce the virus into
        heavily populated areas with high mosquito density and where most people have little or no immunity, due to
        lack of vaccination. In these conditions, infected mosquitoes of the Aedes aegypti species transmit the
        virus from person to person."</p>
    <p><em>How can you prevent yellow fever?</em><br>
        The article <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/yellow-fever">"Yellow
            Fever"</a> states, "Yellow fever is prevented by an extremely effective vaccine, which is safe and
        affordable. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to grant sustained immunity and life-long
        protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. The vaccine provides
        effective immunity within 10 days for 80-100% of people vaccinated, and within 30 days for more than 99% of
        people vaccinated."</p>
    <p><em>How do vaccines work?</em><br>
        Vaccines are a small amount of a virus that is injected into your body through a needle. The amount of the virus
        in the vaccine is small enough to do little or no harm to your body, but large enough for your body to grow
        antibodies
        against the virus and learn to fight it.</p>
    <p><em>How can you treat yellow fever?</em><br>
        Supportive treatment in hospitals increases survival rates for yellow fever. Currently, there are no anti-viral
        drugs or treatments specifically for yellow fever.</p>
    <p><em>What is an organization that helps people with yellow fever?</em><br>
        The Elminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy was launched in 2017. It includes over 50 partners that
        participate in preventing, detecting, and responding to yellow fever cases and outbreaks in 40 at-risk countries
        in the Americas and Africa. It is expected that by 2026, over 1 billion people will be protected against yellow
        fever.</p>
    <h2>About the Black Death:</h2>
    <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150225145949-aman-rat.jpg?q=w_3049,h_2048,x_0,y_0,c_fill"
        alt="Image of a rat, which is a rodent known to spread the Black Death." width="400">
    <p><em>What was the Black Death?</em><br>
        The Black Death, formally known as the Bubonic Plague, was a epidemic of bubonic plague that manifested
        worldwide from 1346 to 1353. It was especially
        common in Europe and Asia. The plague came to Europe in October 1347, when 12 ships arrived from the Black Sea
        and
        docked at a Sicilian port called Messina. Most sailors on the ships were dead, and anyone who was still alive
        was extremely ill and covered in black boils that oozed pus and blood. The ships were ordered out of the harbor,
        but the virus spread in Europe anyway. During the next five years, the Black Death killed over 20 million people
        in Europe, which is almost a third of the continent's population at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>How was the Black Death transmitted?</em><br>
        The article <a target="_blank" href="https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/black-death">"Black Death"</a>
        states, "The Black Death was terrifyingly, indiscriminately contagious: 'the mere touching of the clothes,''
        wrote Boccaccio, 'appeared to itself to communicate the malady to the toucher.'' The disease was also
        terrifyingly efficient. People who were perfectly healthy when they went to bed at night could be dead by
        morning." Scientifically, the Black Death was spread from one person to another through the air, as well as
        through bites from infected rats and fleas.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>What were the symptoms of the Black Death?</em><br>
        The symptoms of the include, but are not limited to swellings in the armpits or groin that exude pus and blood,
        chills, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, pains and aches, and quick death.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>How deadly was the Black Death</em><br>
        The Black Death was extremely deadly, especially because of the miniscule amount of availabe healthcare at the
        time it was most common. Healthy people could go to sleep at night and be dead by the time the morning
        came. You were very unlikely to survive the virus once you got infected.
    </p>
    <p><em>Where is the Black Death most common?</em><br>
        The Black Death is the most common in Europe and Asia, but did exist worldwide.</p>
    <p><em>How can you prevent the Black Death?</em><br>
        Using sanitation and other practices of public-health greatly reduce the spread of the Black Death.</p>
    <p><em>How can you treat the Black Death?</em><br>
        Phsyicians used unsophisticated techniques for treatment such as boil-lancing and bloodletting. These practices
        were both unsantitary and dangerous. They also used practices based in superstition such as bathing in vinegar
        or rosewater and burning herbs. Most healthy people tried extremely hard to avoid the sick.</p>
    <p><em>Did the Black Death end, or does it still exist?</em><br>
        The Black Death never truly ended, but instead lessened in severity after rulers made rules about isolation and
        social distancing. The plague still exists today, and has about 1,000 to 3,000 cases per year.</p>
    <p><strong>Many people believed that the Black Death was a punishment from God.</strong></p>
